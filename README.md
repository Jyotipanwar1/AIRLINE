# Data Preprocessing and EDA

Our data had significant no. of missing values in it,mainly 
40% of the data as null or missing.
We could not think of dropping the null values because of the percentage of total data it
beared, so we thought about mean, median imputation but it would create so many
similar data points i.e around 40% of the total data would have the same value of
certain columns
